# **Harmonizing gaze and nature: Integrating plant signals and eye tracking data for a music transcoding compositional process**

# 👁️🎼 **From Gaze, Image & Plant Data to Music** 🌱🎶  

## **🔬 Data-driven musical composition: Analyzing eye movements, images & nature**  

This notebook explores how **gaze tracking, image processing, and plant data** can be transformed into **musical elements** through structured analysis. The goal is to create a **data-driven composition** that reflects visual attention patterns and natural elements in music.  

### **✨ What does this notebook do?**  
- **Processes gaze-tracking data** to analyze visual focus points  
- **Extracts features from images** to influence musical parameters  
- **Analyzes plant growth and environmental data** for musical inspiration  
- **Maps numerical values to musical elements** (pitch, rhythm, dynamics)  
- **Generates and exports music compositions** in **MusicXML and MIDI**  
- **Visualizes gaze patterns, image textures, and plant metrics**
