# **Harmonizing Gaze and Nature: Integrating Plant Signals and Eye Tracking Data for a Music Transcoding Compositional Process**

# 👁️🎼 **From Gaze, Image & Plant Data to Music** 🌱🎶  

## **🔬 Data-Driven Musical Composition: Analyzing Eye movements, Images & Nature**  

This notebook explores how **gaze tracking, image processing, and plant data** can be transformed into **musical elements** through structured analysis. The goal is to create a **data-driven composition** that reflects visual attention patterns and natural elements in music.  

### **✨ What Does This Notebook Do?**  
✅ **Processes gaze-tracking data** to analyze visual focus points  
✅ **Extracts features from images** to influence musical parameters  
✅ **Analyzes plant growth and environmental data** for musical inspiration  
✅ **Maps numerical values to musical elements** (pitch, rhythm, dynamics)  
✅ **Generates and exports music compositions** in **MusicXML and MIDI**  
✅ **Visualizes gaze patterns, image textures, and plant metrics**
